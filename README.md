## 🚀 About The Project

This project was to be a plant image identifier.

We wanted to make an app that could take and identify photos of your plant to provide care requirements for the (hopefully correctly) identified plant.

We also implemented a chat bot functionality so that you could ask specific questions regarding your plant.

- Identify diseases by image
